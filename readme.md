# rcwe (react context with events)

this library helps you by providing a simple (and typed) way
to work with the react context api.

it is inspired by [redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), but with types (using [daggy](https://github.com/fantasyland/daggy) from [fantasy-land](https://github.com/fantasyland)).

### how to use

- first, create some nice types (see [examples/types.js](https://github.com/diasbruno/rcwe/blob/master/examples/types.js))
- create the context with rcwe api (see [examples/state.js](https://github.com/diasbruno/rcwe/blob/master/examples/state.js))
- you are now ready to use it (see [examples/index.js](https://github.com/diasbruno/rcwe/blob/master/examples/index.js))
